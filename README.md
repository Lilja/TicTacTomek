# TicTacTome

[One of google's code jam challenges.](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/dashboard?c=2270488), implemented in Java, written by yours truly!

# Run it
`$ javac src/main/java/Deliverable.java && java Deliverable.class`

or open it up in intellij and run in it there. Just make sure there it can reach some files "A-small-practice" or "A-large-practice", and be able to write to "stdout.out" or "stdout2.out"

# Unit tests
Tests rely on JUnit 4, make sure you have the dependecy. I tried to do something in maven but i'm not sure it works. So yeah.
